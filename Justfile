# Print version information
version:

    @echo "Commit:  {{ commit }}"
    @echo "Date:    {{ date }}"

# Sync Vale styles and dictionaries. Run once after cloning the repo,
# and whenever .vale.ini's Packages list changes. CI runs this before
# `just lint-prose`.

# Run pre-commit hooks on changed files (the everyday invocation).
prek:
    prek

# Run pre-commit hooks on every file in the tree. Useful after a
# hook config change or before a release sweep.
prek-all:
    prek run --all-files

# Install the project's pre-commit hooks (commit-msg, pre-commit,
# pre-push). New contributors run this once after `just setup`; the
# `just setup` recipe does NOT run it automatically because installing
# hooks modifies .git/ and contributors may prefer to opt in.

# Generate the full CHANGELOG.md from Conventional Commit history.
# `cog changelog` emits Markdown without an H1; the pipeline prepends
# one and runs rumdl with MD024 (duplicate headings) disabled so
# adjacent releases with the same section names don't fight the
# linter.

# committing the regeneration.
